# Python-WK-4
Python program that reads a file, modifies its content by adding line numbers, and writes the result to a new file

Explanation
Reading the File:

The try block attempts to open and read the file. If successful, it stores each line in a list.

Specific exceptions (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, OSError) handle common issues, providing user-friendly messages. A general Exception catch-all handles unexpected errors.

Modifying Content:

Each line from the input file is prepended with its line number using enumerate for easy tracking.

Writing the New File:

The output filename is generated by inserting "_modified" before the original file's extension using os.path.splitext.

Another try block handles potential writing errors, such as write permissions or disk space issues, ensuring the user is informed of any problems.
